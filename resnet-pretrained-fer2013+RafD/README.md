# Emotion Recognition using ResNet CNN Architecture

This project attempts to recognize user emotion using a convolutional
neural network (CNN). The particular architecture used is a residual
neural network based (ResNet).

The neural net can recognize 7 emotions with relatively high accuracy:
(1) Anger, (2) Disgust, (3) Fear, (4) Happy, (5) Sad, (6) Surprise and
(7) Neutral.

The dataset for training the neural net came from the Carrier and
Courville Facial Expression Dataset hosted on Kaggle.

### How to Run:

##### Emotion Recognition

(1) In order to get going quickly, run the face_tracking.py file and
the program will begin to track your emotions via webcam.

##### Neural Net Training

(1) The neural net can be re-trained to obtain a different model via
the emotion_recognition.py file.

The current model has an accuracy of ~94.8% on the test dataset.

##### Hardware Requirements
(1) Webcam, (2) Graphics card supporting Tensorflow

Note: Program has only been tested under Ubuntu 14.04 with an NVIDIA GTX 1070.
